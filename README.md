[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App

# This app was created via a tutorial where I learned and wrote the application via following along with someone elses code, therefore I take no ownership for it's design or implementation. It served as a very good tutorial for teaching me Ruby on Rails and working with services such as Heroku, Stripe, Amazon Web Services and GitHub! Also I refamiliarised myself with linux which is an added bonus.

Feel free to explore the app which I plan to keep live for maybe a year.
