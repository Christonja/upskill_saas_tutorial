[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App

This app was created via a tutorial where I learned and wrote the application via codealong, therefore I take no ownership for it's design or implementation. It served as a very good tutorial for teaching me Ruby on Rails and working with services such as Heroku, Stripe, Amazon Web Services and GitHub. A link to the app is below.
