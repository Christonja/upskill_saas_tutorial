[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App

This app was created via a tutorial where I learned and wrote the application via following along with someone elses code, therefore I take no ownership for it's design or implementation. It served as a very good tutorial for teaching me Ruby on Rails and working with services such as Heroku, Stripe, Amazon Web Services and GitHub! Also I refamiliarised myself with linux which is an added bonus.

Feel free to explore the app which I plan to keep live for maybe a year. If you want to sign up for a pro account I'd recommend using test details as I don't plan collect any actual money from it. It uses Stripe in a test environment so I wouldn't collect anything anyway!
